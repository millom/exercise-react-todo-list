### Step 1 - _(No router)_

Remember here to use state und utilize props. Also place the state(s) in the appropriate component(s).

[ ] As a user I want to be able to view all my todos in the same place, to get a good overview of what I have to do.

[ ] As user I want to be able to add new todos to my todo list so I can update my todo list when I find something else that I need to do.

[ ] As a user I want to mark a todo as completed so I can see which todos I have left to do.

[ ] As a user I want to remove a todo from the list so I can keep my list as clean and short as possible.

[ ] As a user I want a timestamp to be added to my new todos in order better se how old all the todos are.

[ ] As a user I want to be able to put my name _(author of a todo)_ on a todo, so everyone in my family can add their own todos to the todo list.
